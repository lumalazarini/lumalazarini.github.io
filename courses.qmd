### Statistics for Environmental Science (ENVS 193DS)

This course introduced concepts in probability, statistical inference, and hypothesis testing through the lens of environmental science. I learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using R and RStudio. I also developed skills in interpreting statistical results, evaluating assumptions, and clearly communicating findings, both visually and in writing, making this course especially relevant for data-driven environmental work. Attached below are some of the types of data visualizations I learned to create.

### Groundwater Analyses and the Environment (ENVS193 GW)

This course introduced the fundamentals of groundwater hydrology, including the hydrologic cycle, aquifer geology, and principles of groundwater flow and storage. I explored groundwater management strategies through California policies, applied quantitative methods to analyze basin conditions, and gained an introduction to ArcGIS for mapping aquifers. Attached below are examples of mapping assignments done in this class.

### Environmental Impact Analysis (ENVS 165A/B)

This course examined the theory and practice of environmental impact assessment, with a focus on how environmental impacts are evaluated and documented for proposed projects. It emphasized the legal and policy frameworks governing environmental review in the United States, particularly CEQA and its relationship to NEPA, including the strengths and limitations of these systems in real-world decision-making.

Through applied coursework, I conducted CEQA-based environmental review and am developing a full Environmental Impact Report (EIR). This includes analyzing project impacts across air quality, biological resources, noise, land use, transportation, water resources, and cumulative impacts, with an emphasis on clear, structured analysis and defensible conclusions.
