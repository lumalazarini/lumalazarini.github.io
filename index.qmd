I'm Luma, a fourth-year Environmental Studies B.S. student at UC Santa Barbara. I combine data analysis, project coordination, and problem-solving skills with a passion for water resources, sustainability, and ocean conservation. Outside of academics, you'll usually find me at the beach, crocheting, or spending time with friends. Feel free to explore my site to learn more about what I do and what I care about!
